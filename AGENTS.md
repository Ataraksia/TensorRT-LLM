## General Guidelines

- If you don't see the expected output when running commands, you should try again until you do.
- When implementing complex features, break them down into logical components but ensure each component is fully implemented and integrated properly with the rest of the system.
- Always use the Context7 tool to validate the functionality you use from other libraries.  Always use the Sequential Thinking tool in place of regular thinking as it has been proven to measurably improve your problem solving ability.
- Always complete your assigned tasks in their entirety prior to requesting user validation. If you encounter ambiguity, unclear requirements, or technical blockers that prevent progress, you should attempt to bypass the issue and continue working on other aspects of the task.
- Implement **EVERYTHING** that is necessary to complete the task with full functionality. Never skip a task or subtask, regardless of complexity or time requirements - work through each component methodically and completely, even if it seems impossible.
- Don't create placeholder functions, stub classes, incomplete implementations. If you encounter such functions, you should always implement them in its entirety.
- After you believe you have finished a task, review the entire implementation to ensure that all aspects of the task have been addressed and that the solution is robust, efficient, and maintainable.
- Don't over-engineer! Build only what is necessary to achieve the goal and no more. Don't prepare for all possibilities. Make your code as concise as possible.
- It is important when debugging something that involves a large amount of iterations that you output the log to a file rather than the console.
- After you finish making changes, always run git status and git diff (or git diff --stat for a quick view) so you can see exactly what you’ve  altered compared to the previous commit. That lets you double‑check for accidental edits, confirm formatting, and make sure the diff reflects the intended logic before moving on to testing or next steps.
